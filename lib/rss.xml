 <br><br>We use a custom Microsoft Access database to manage the registered kids and all of their associated info. This database is also the means by which we track the breakdown of our various tribes.<br>
<br><br><br>Since registration is not directly linked to this database, the information must be semi-manually imported once initial registration closes. To do this, export the registration form data from the registration platform (Clover, Google Forms, etc.). The data will either be output as a .csv (Comma Separated Values) file. Open this file in Microsoft Excel and save it as a .xlsx (Microsoft Excel Workbook) file for ease of use.<br>Go through the two address columns and merge any entries in "Address Line 2" with the respective entries in "Address Line 1."<br>Remove the following unnecessary columns and all their content:<br>
<br>Address Line 2
<br>Country
<br>Food Allergies (not the column with the actual allergies, just the column that lists the yes or no answers).
<br>Other Allergies/Medical Needs
<br>Other Allergies/Medical Needs - Value
<br>Created At
<br>Reverse the order of the first two columns so that the "Last Name" column becomes Column A and the "First Name" column becomes Column B.<br>The first row in the spreadsheet contains the column header information and must match the order and naming scheme found in the "Header Template.xlsx" spreadsheet. You can copy the data from that file and replace the contents of this first row for convenience. Verify that everything matches and that the headers line up with the appropriate columns.]]></description><link>https://isaiah20412.github.io/VBS-Documentation/registration/access-database.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Registration/Access Database.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Isaiah Payton]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:06:28 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Timeline]]></title><description><![CDATA[
