 <br><br>We use Avery 5160 sticky labels to address each postcard. We print the addresses on the labels from a Word document that connects to Access and pulls information from the registration database.<br><br>The Word document is located in the \\LEVI\Pictures\VBS\{Current Year - VBS Name}\Family Group Photos\{Current Year} Postcards folder. Navigate to that location and open the "Address Labels.docx" file.<br>The following dialog box will likely appear - click yes when prompted.<br>

 <br><br><br>The \\LEVI\Pictures\VBS\{Current Year - VBS Name}\Family Group Photos folder should have .jpg photos of each tribe, labeled accordingly. (You may have to coordinate with the photographer to get these - but you basically just want the best non-goofy picture of each tribe.) Crop them if necessary - you can look at previous years to see approximately what they should end up looking like.<br>
<img src="https://isaiah20412.github.io/VBS-Documentation/lib/media/pasted-image-20240605160502.png"><br><br>
<br>Navigate to the \\LEVI\Pictures\VBS\{Current Year - VBS Name}\Family Group Photos\{Current Year} Postcards folder and open the "VBS Family Group Postcard Template.pub" file.
<br>Save the file in the same folder as "{Tribe Name}.pub"
<br>Replace the picture with the respective tribe photo from the location mentioned above.
<br><br>In Publisher, select "File" then "Print."<br>
Load card stock in the printer. You can load it in tray one after removing the regular paper, or you can use the bypass tray and change the print settings accordingly.<br>Set the "Print on Both Sides" option to "Flip sheets on short edge."<br>
Set the "Copies of each page" field to the amount of kids in the tribe as well as an extra for each junior helper. Publisher will automatically tile the postcards as needed.<br>

 <br><br>We use a custom Microsoft Access database to manage the registered kids and all of their associated info. This database is also the means by which we track the breakdown of our various tribes.<br>
<br><br><br>Since registration is not directly linked to this database, the information must be semi-manually imported once initial registration closes. To do this, export the registration form data from the registration platform (Clover, Google Forms, etc.). The data will either be output as a .csv (Comma Separated Values) file. Open this file in Microsoft Excel and save it as a .xlsx (Microsoft Excel Workbook) file for ease of use.<br>Go through the two address columns and merge any entries in "Address Line 2" with the respective entries in "Address Line 1."<br>Remove the following unnecessary columns and all their content:<br>
<br>Address Line 2
<br>Country
<br>Food Allergies (not the column with the actual allergies, just the column that lists the yes or no answers).
<br>Other Allergies/Medical Needs
<br>Other Allergies/Medical Needs - Value
<br>Created At
<br>Reverse the order of the first two columns so that the "Last Name" column becomes Column A and the "First Name" column becomes Column B.<br>The first row in the spreadsheet contains the column header information and must match the order and naming scheme found in the "Header Template.xlsx" spreadsheet. You can copy the data from that file and replace the contents of this first row for convenience. Verify that everything matches and that the headers line up with the appropriate columns.]]></description><link>https://isaiah20412.github.io/VBS-Documentation/registration/access-database.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Registration/Access Database.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Isaiah Payton]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 00:06:28 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
